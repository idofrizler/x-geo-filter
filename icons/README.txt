ICON FILES NEEDED

This extension requires three icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

QUICK SOLUTIONS:

1. Online Generator (Easiest):
   Visit: https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/
   Search for: "globe" or "flag"
   Download and rename the files

2. Use Any PNG Images:
   Copy any three PNG images here and rename them to:
   icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

3. Create Simple Colored Squares:
   You can use any image editor to create 16x16, 48x48, 
   and 128x128 pixel colored squares

Once you add the icons, the extension will load properly in Chrome.

See INSTALLATION.md in the project root for detailed instructions.
